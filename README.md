## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to "create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML". The user story is: AS A user, I want to be able to submit a burger name and be able to see it on the left side of screen. I WANT to be able to click a "Devour it!" button and the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The assignment was provided by Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp.
